- 👋 Hi, I’m @LuciusOfLegend
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, gaming and game design, as well as Chess, boardgames and nature.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to mod Minecraft using Fabric, and I hope to mod Hytale (a game that's in developement) when I releases.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making Minecraft mods, servers, or hyping for Hytale.
- 📫 You can reach me through Email (luciusiber@gmail.com), on Discord (LuciusOfLegend#4650), or here on GitHub.
