### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm @LuciusOfLegend.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting into the Legend League on chess.com
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code in java so I can mod Minecraft and, someday, Hytale.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm interested in making Fabric mods for Minecraft, making fun Minecraft servers, gaming, doing those things with others and lots more besides!
- ðŸ’¬ If you want to mod Minecraft and Hytale too, I HIGHLY recommend these tutorial series by Kaupenjoe [Fabric 1.18.1 modding](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKGarocXCE1ECgBI1_Z_Yr4qMdhjVi3kg) and [Coding in Java](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKGarocXCE1FeXvEogpjz4SvHxF_FJRO6)
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via Email (luciusiber@gmail.com) or Discord (LuciusOfLegend#4650).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once took a vacation to the tallest mountain in West Virginia!
